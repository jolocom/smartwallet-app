Jolocom GmbH, Waldemarstrasse 37A, 10999 Berlin (“Jolocom”)

Jolocom provides you with the SmartWallet mobile app ("App"), which you can download to your mobile device. 

The protection of personal data is of great importance at Jolocom. This privacy policy explains whether personal data is collected when using the App and for what purpose it is processed. Processing in this case means any form of use of the data, e.g. collecting, recording, storing, transmitting, displaying and deleting. Personal data is only processed as far as it is necessary for the communication with the user.
We observe the principle of data minimization and comply with all applicable legal provisions on the protection of personal data and data security. In particular, corresponding data is only processed if a legal permission / legal basis exists.    

The legal basis for data processing is the German General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), more specifically: Art. 6 (1) a) and Art. 7 DSGVO, Art. 6 (1) b), f) DSGVO and Art. 6 (1) c) DSGVO. 

The German DSGVO is in turn in compliance with European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

I.	Name and contact details of the responsible person 
The entity responsible, in correspondence with Art. 4 DSGVO, for the processing of personal data is:

Jolocom GmbH
Waldemarstrasse 37A
10999 Berlin
info@jolocom.com


II. Type of data processed / purpose of processing / legal basis
1. User and device data
We are not privy or have access to your personal data at any time unless you contact us via the form or via the email address provided in the App. 

When you download the App, the information required for this purpose is transmitted to the Apple AppStore or GooglePlay Store (the "App Stores"), i.e. in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this collection of data and are not responsible for it. For more detailed information regarding the purpose and scope of the app stores' data processing, please refer to the app stores' respective privacy statements. 

After the app has been successfully loaded onto your mobile device, it can be used without accessing the Internet. No personal data is collected by us when you use the app. The identity information that you provide to the app for the purpose of use (e.g. name, address, driver's license, ID card) is stored only locally and encrypted on your mobile device. If you provide this information to participating partners ("issuers", "verifiers" or "third-party providers") for verification, the privacy policy of the issuer, verifier or third-party provider applies with regard to the purpose and scope of the data processing. Again, Jolocom has no access to the data or the data flow. 

We do not undertake any verification of the data. Likewise, it is your sole responsibility to save the stored content and to make data backups. 

Personal data will only be collected, stored and processed in case of contact initiated by you, as far as it is necessary to answer your request. 

The above-mentioned data is required to enable the download of the app from the app stores. We do not receive any personal data in this process. 

The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) a), b) and f) DSGVO. 


2. Cookies
No cookies are used when using the app. 

3. Contacting
If you contact us via the contact form provided in the app or via our e-mail address, we will process the contact data you have provided - name, e-mail address and any information you may have provided in addition to this - for the purpose of responding to the request. On the metadata level, your IP address and App version will also be transmitted.

The processing of the contact data used by you is indispensable to get in touch with you and to be able to answer your request. If additional data has been provided, processing serves to individualize it and be able to respond to your request in the best possible way.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) b) and f) DSGVO. 


III. Duration of storage
Your data will be stored for as long as is necessary in each case to fulfil the above-mentioned purposes.

As soon as this is no longer the case, e.g. after a complete response to your request, they will be deleted or, in case of commercial or tax retention obligations, blocked if and for as long as the law requires this (Art. 6 para. 1 c) DSGVO). From the point in time when legal storage obligations no longer apply, the data will be deleted, unless you have expressly consented to further use (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO). 


IV.	Disclosure of data to third parties/transfer to third countries

In principle, the data you provide will not be made available to third parties. In individual cases, however, it may be necessary to pass on your personal data to companies entrusted by us with the provision of individual services (e.g. cloud providers) in order to execute the contract. 
If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to third parties, transfer it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of a legal permission, on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. If we commission third-party providers with the processing of data on the basis of a so-called "order processing agreement", this is done on the basis of Art. 28 DSGVO.
For their part, the third parties are obliged to comply with the statutory provisions when handling and processing this data. 
It is possible that the registered office of a third party is located in a third country, i.e. in a country in which neither the DSGVO nor the GDPR does not have direct legal effect. In this case, data will only be transferred if your consent has been given, an adequate level of data protection prevails, for example due to individual agreements, the use of EU standard contractual clauses, the existence of an EU adequacy decision, or other legal permission exists. 
A transfer to authorities and state institutions entitled to receive information is also possible, but will only take place within the framework of the legal obligations to provide information and in the event of a court decision obligating us to do so. In these cases, Jolocom GmbH may provide the information, e.g. for the assertion, exercise and defense of legal claims, enforcement of existing contracts, in the context of allegations of fraud, security measures or generally legally applicable regulations.

Personal data will not be passed on outside the scope described here without express consent.

Under no circumstances will we sell or rent personal data to third parties.

VI. Data Subject Rights
As a data subject affected by the processing of personal data, you are entitled to the rights listed below. These rights result from the requirements of the DSGVO and are reproduced here in a partially simplified form. 

1. Right to revoke the declaration of consent 
Pursuant to Art. 7 (3) DSGVO, you have the right to revoke your consent to processing at any time. The lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation is not affected. The right of revocation can be exercised by an informal declaration. A written declaration or optionally an e-mail to the above contact address is sufficient.

2. Right of information
Pursuant to Art. 15 DSGVO, you have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether personal data relating to you is being processed. If this is the case, you have a right to information about this personal data and the information referred to in Art. 15 (1) DSGVO. This includes in particular: the purpose of the processing, the categories of data processed, the recipients to whom data have been or will be disclosed, as far as possible the planned duration of storage or the criteria for the duration of storage. 

3. Right to rectification 
Pursuant to Art. 16 DSGVO, you have the right to demand that we correct any inaccurate personal data concerning you without undue delay. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data - also by means of a supplementary declaration.

4. Right to deletion 
Pursuant to Art. 17 DSGVO, you have the right to demand that we delete personal data concerning you without undue delay. We are obliged to delete personal data without delay if one of the reasons listed in Art. 17(1) DSGVO applies. These reasons include, for example, that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.

5. Right to restriction of processing
Pursuant to Art. 18 DSGVO, you have the right to demand that we restrict processing if one of the conditions listed in Art. 18 DSGVO applies. This includes, for example, that you dispute the accuracy of the personal data. Then we may only process the data in a restricted manner for as long as it takes to verify the accuracy of the personal data. 

6. Right to data portability 
Pursuant to Art. 20 DSGVO, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You have the right to transfer this data to another controller, i.e. another entity that processes data, without hindrance, provided that the original processing was based on consent or was necessary for the performance of a contract. 

7. Right of objection 
Pursuant to Art. 21 DSGVO, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you if such data is processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO and there are grounds for doing so based on your personal situation. You may object to the processing of data for the purpose of direct marketing at any time. Personal data will then no longer be processed for this purpose. The right to object can be exercised by means of an informal declaration. A written statement or, optionally, an e-mail to the above contact address is sufficient.

8. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling.
Pursuant to Art. 22 of the DSGVO, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affecting you. Article 22 (1) of the DSGVO provides for exceptions to this right, although Article 22 (4) of the DSGVO in turn provides for partial exceptions. 

9 Right to complain to a supervisory authority 
Pursuant to Art. 77 DSGVO, and without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes above mentioned regulation.
