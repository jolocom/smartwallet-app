SmartWallet App - Terms of Use
Jolocom GmbH, Waldemarstrasse 37A, 10999 Berlin, Germany (“Jolocom”)


I.     Preamble / Validity and changes to the Terms of Use

Jolocom GmbH is the provider of a mobile software application, the Jolocom SmartWallet App ("App"), for various operating systems (iOS, Android). The “User” is the person who downloads the app to his, her, or their mobile device (“download”) and / or uses the app installed on a mobile device. Jolocom and the user are hereinafter referred to each individually as "Party" or collectively as "Parties".

Jolocom is of the opinion that data protection and data security go hand in hand with transparent technology. Jolocom does not see or have access to the User's data, and guarantees full transparency with regard to the source code of the SmartWallet. The code can be viewed at any time on the GitHub developer platform in order to guarantee the highest level of transparency to the User.

Since Jolocom has no access to a User's App, changes to the App will always be accompanied by a new version. Jolocom will keep the source code freely visible even with such new versions.

The download and use of the app are free of charge.

These Terms of Use regulate the relationship between Jolocom and the Users. By downloading the app and / or using it, the User agrees to the validity of the Terms of Use. They also apply if the User operates according to other (e.g. the User’s own) general terms and conditions and these contain conflicting or deviating regulations. General terms and conditions of the User do not apply, even if Jolocom does not expressly contradict them.

The Terms of Use apply as stated to any updates or other changes to the App, unless otherwise notified by Jolocom.

In addition, the statutory provisions apply for the free provision of the software application, in particular §§ 516 ff. BGB (Schenkung / Donation).

Jolocom reserves the right to change these Terms of Use for objective reasons (e.g. change in jurisdiction or law, change in economic conditions or the business model). In this case, Jolocom provides an updated version of the App for the User to download.


II.     Purpose of the App / Scope of service

The App enables a decentralized digital identity and authentication management. They allow the User to create, exchange and manage unique identity information.
The data (e.g. name, address, proof of insurance, identity card information) are exclusively stored locally and in unencrypted form on the User's mobile device. They can be verified through submission to identification and trust services ("Issuers"). The User decides which of the User’s verified data to make available to which company.
The App is therefore purely a tool for organizing and managing one’s own (personal) data. It is the sole responsibility of the User to save the stored content and make data backups.
Jolocom has no knowledge of the data and does not have any access to the data input by the User, and therefore does not verify the data independently.
The App does not provide any storage space. All data inputted into the App are stored exclusively on the respective mobile device of the User.
The internet connection and the functioning infrastructure of the mobile device involved (e.g. permissible device, version of the operating system, storage space on the mobile device) are not part of Jolocom's services. The User is responsible for these.


III.     Conclusion of the agreement / Provision of the App

Jolocom provides the App via the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, or the Microsoft GitHub platform (jointly "Download Platforms") for download on the User's mobile device free of charge.
With the download of the App onto a mobile device and / or the use of an already installed App, a usage agreement is concluded between Jolocom and the User. The User must be at least 18 years of age at the time when the agreement is concluded.
Neither Apple Inc., as the operator of the Apple App Store, nor Google Inc., as the operator of the Google Play Store, nor GitHub Inc., as the operator of the GitHub, become contractual partners of this User agreement. Jolocom has no influence on any terms and conditions of the Download Platforms or the data collection there, and bears no responsibility in this regard.
There is no right to constant and uninterrupted availability of the App. Temporary service interruptions due to standard maintenance times, network disruptions or in the event of force majeure are possible. However, Jolocom endeavors to achieve the highest possible availability and to rectify disruptions as quickly as possible.


IV.    Download / Use

Downloading the App as well as access to notifications, updates, or other changes require a functioning internet connection and a functioning infrastructure of the mobile device involved (e.g. permissible device, version of the operating system, storage space on the device).
The technical requirements for downloading and using the App are shown in the description in the Download Platforms.
Functions such as opening and looking through the App after the download / update are also available offline. Internet connection is therefore not required while using these functions. Interactions with Issuers, however, require a working internet connection.


V.     Notifications / Updates / Changes

Jolocom reserves the right to change, interrupt, or discontinue the App and its functions at its own discretion.
In the event of any change, e.g. changes in the service, the functions, the content, or the terms of use, Jolocom will provide a new version of the App. It is the sole responsibility of the User to establish a connection to the internet at regular intervals and to update the App to the latest version in accordance with the terms of use of the respective Download Platform.
If the updates require further authorizations, the User will be informed of this before the installation. If the User does not agree to these further authorizations, there will be no update and this may affect the operation of the App.
Additional functions and services within the App may be or become subjects to charge. In this case, Jolocom will notify you of the prices and features in advance. The use of new paid functions and services is at the sole discretion of the User.


VI.    Obligations of the User

A registration is not required.
It is up to the User to ensure the functionality of the working environment of the App (e.g. permissible device, version of the operating system, storage space on the device) and to test usability in the specific situation before starting productive use of the app.
The User undertakes to provide only correct, complete, and truthful information, in particular with regard to the User’s identity. The User safeguards his, her, or their App-based identity from inspection, access, and use by third parties.
It is the sole responsibility of the User to save the stored content and to back up data.
The App may not be used in any way that harms third parties, is improper, or violates legal provisions and regulations of German law.


VII.    Copyrights, rights of use, and other ancillary copyrights

All copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other ancillary copyrights to the App are exclusively due to Jolocom in the relationship between the Parties. The creation or addition of content in(to) the App does not give rise to any joint copyright of the User.
The User is granted the simple, non-transferable right to use the App as intended.
The User is not authorized to edit or change the App in any way (e.g. making changes to the (source) code, software, or documentation, for instance, through reverse engineering, manipulation, decompilation, disassembly; or similar changes).
Any form of imitation, reproduction, sale, or other distribution of the App or parts of the App by the User is prohibited.


VIII.    Guarantee

Jolocom is only liable for material and legal defects in the provided App if Jolocom has fraudulently concealed the defect from the User.


IX.    Liability

In addition, Jolocom is only liable for damage caused by itself or its vicarious agents in the event of willful intent and gross negligence.
The objection of contributory negligence remains open to Jolocom. In particular, the User is obliged to use the App as intended, to back up data, and to ensure a functional working environment.
Jolocom is expressly not liable for the loss of content and any resulting damage that is based on damage / loss of the mobile device or on improper use of the App caused by the User, or if the User has not made a backup and this has resulted in a loss of data.
Jolocom has no knowledge of and no access to the content created or added by the User. Jolocom is therefore also not liable for the legality and lawful possession of the content.


X.    Indemnity agreement

The User will indemnify Jolocom from all asserted claims by third parties that relate to the violation of the User’s rights. This does not apply if the User is not responsible for the infringement.
In disputes with third parties, the User will immediately provide Jolocom with all necessary information and support Jolocom as best as possible in defending against or asserting claims.


XI.     Data protection

The User has acknowledged Jolocom's Privacy Policy.
The User confirms that personal data transmitted to Jolocom by him or by third parties at the User’s request has been collected and processed in accordance with the relevant data protection provisions.
If the consent of those concerned is required, the User ensures that all persons concerned have taken note of Jolocom's Privacy Policy and have given any necessary declaration of consent.


XII.    Duration and termination of use

The User agreement runs for an indefinite period and can be terminated by Jolocom and / or the User at any time without notice.
The User can terminate use at any time by deleting the App from the User’s mobile device.
Jolocom is entitled at any time to discontinue operation of the App in such a way that the necessary updates are no longer made available. In this case, Jolocom will inform the User in a timely manner by means of a notification via the App.


XIII.     Final provisions

The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, with exception of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). This applies to consumers only insofar as the protection granted by the mandatory provisions of the law of the state in which the consumer is habitually resident is not withdrawn.
If the User is an entrepreneur, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from contractual relationships between the Parties is the jurisdiction of Jolocom’s registered office. Jolocom is entitled, but not obliged, to take legal action in the jurisdiction where the User is registered or has residence.
This text is subject to German law and should be interpreted according to German legal understanding. This English version is for informational purposes only and is not a component of the legal transaction. In the event of discrepancies between the German and English versions, only the German version applies.
