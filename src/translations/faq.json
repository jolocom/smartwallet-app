    "question": "What happens if my phone gets lost or stolen?",
    "answer": "You can regain control over your wallet using the secret phrase created during setup of your SmartWallet. This will not recover any documents or other information stored in a wallet on a lost device. We highly recommend making backups of your SmartWallet (via the settings menu) in order to safeguard the contents of your wallet."

    "question": "Who access to my data?",
    "answer": "All your data is stored and managed on your device. You are in full control over who gets access to information. Jolocom has no access to the data on your device nor does anybody else without your permission. In case you grant access to information to another party, like your driver’s’ license in our car sharing company example, you can always see what you shared with them and request them to delete your information. In fact, you can always quickly and easily check which service has access to which data. This provides you with an instant overview over your connections."

    "question": "What can the SmartWallet do?",
