    "moreInfoDescription": "SmartWallet allows you to use the German eID function (e.g. with the German electronic residence permit) without having to go through other apps. \n\nIf the German eID function is required during a registration process, the SmartWallet will prompt you to hold your eID card up to the NFC reader on your smartphone and enter your 6-digit eID PIN. You also have the option to specify which data you want to share and to check with whom you share it. In addition, you can change your transport PIN to unlock the eID card, change your eID card PIN and unlock the eID card if necessary.\n\nFor the time being, the German eID function is only available to participants of the pilot applications from the research program \"Secure Digital Identities\" of the federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action. Furthermore, Jolocom is involved in the ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA projects. The German eID function was implemented on the basis of the AusweisApp2 SDK and uses its existing infrastructure (Online-Ausweisfunktion).",
